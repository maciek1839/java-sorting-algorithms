## [2.3.0 (2021-03-21)](https://gitlab.com/ShowMeYourCodeYouTube/java-sorting-algorithms/-/compare/java-sorting-2.2.0...java-sorting-2.3.0)

### Changed

- Update benchmark results
- Improve sorting algorithms (CocktailShakerSort, HeapSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, SelectionSort, ShellSort)

### Fixed

- The benchmark table formatting

## [2.2.0 (2021-03-16)](https://gitlab.com/ShowMeYourCodeYouTube/java-sorting-algorithms/-/compare/java-sorting-2.1.0...java-sorting-2.2.0)

### Added

- The benchmark table contains execution and algorithms details
- Measure memory during an algorithm execution

### Changed

- The format of saving benchmark results
- Milliseconds to nanoseconds as a default time execution unit
- Refactor a part of algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, Selection Sort
- Create the benchmark results file when it does not exist

## [2.1.0 (2021-03-05)](https://gitlab.com/ShowMeYourCodeYouTube/java-sorting-algorithms/-/compare/java-sorting-2.0.1...java-sorting-2.1.0)

### Added

- A new benchmark option in GUI
- A benchmark table in README.md (it's still empty because algorithms need refactoring)

### Changed

- Adjust packages structure
- Adjust Logback configuration to not show redundant information

## [2.0.1 (2021-02-25)](https://gitlab.com/ShowMeYourCodeYouTube/java-sorting-algorithms/-/compare/java-sorting-2.0.0...java-sorting-2.0.1)
